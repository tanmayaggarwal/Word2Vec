## Word2Vec SkipGram model

This repository contains code to implement the Word2Vec model using the SkipGram architecture.

The following steps are take:
1. Load in text data
2. Pre-process the data, encoding characters as integers
3. Define the context words surrounding a word of interest
4. Define an RNN that predicts the context words when given an input word
5. Train the RNN
6. Visualize the embeddings leaded in the embedding layer
